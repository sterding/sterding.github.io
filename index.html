	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm Xianjun Dong. I work on the human genome as a computer geek.</p>
	<p>While steering myself in the path of Science, I indulge myself in the elegance of the human genome and the complexity of human brain (therefore the brain diseases). I wish I could use my expertise in Computational Biology to find a piece for the puzzle of the human genome. </p>
	<p>I act as the Director of Computational Neuroscience in the <a href="http://www.scherzerlaboratory.org/">Neurogenomics Laboratory</a> and Parkinson Personalized Medicine program in <a href="http://www.brighamandwomens.org">Brigham and Women's Hospital</a>, an Instructor in <a href="http://hms.harvard.edu">Harvard Medical School</a>, and most importantly a father of two lovely girls.</p>
