	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm Xianjun Dong. I work on the human genome as a computer geek.</p>
	<p>While steering myself in the path of Science, I enjoy a lot the beauty lying between the elegance of the human genome and the complexity of human brain. I wish I could fit my two bits in Computational Biology into the jigsaw of the genome research. </p>
	<p>I act as the Director of Computational Neuroscience in Dr. Scherzer's <a href="http://www.scherzerlaboratory.org/">Neurogenomics Laboratory</a> in Brigham and Women's Hospital, an Instructor in Harvard Medical School. I'm running a weekly <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bioinformatics-club">Bioinformatics Club</a> in BWH.</p>
