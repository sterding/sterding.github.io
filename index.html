	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm Xianjun Dong and I work on the human genome as a computer geek.</p>
	<p>Whiling still steering my career path in Science, I indulge myself in the elegance of the human genome and the complexity of human brain (therefore the brain diseases). I wish I could use my expertise in Computational Biology to contribute a piece to the puzzle of the human genome. </p>
	<p>I act as a Director of Computational Neuroscience in <a href="http://www.brighamandwomens.org">Brigham and Women's Hospital</a>, an Instructor in <a href="http://hms.harvard.edu">Harvard Medical School</a>, and most importantly a father of two lovely kids who inherit both my and my wife's X chromosome.</p>
