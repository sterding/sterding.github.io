	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm Xianjun Dong. I work on the human genome as a computer geek.</p>
	<p>While creeping to the peak of Science, I enjoy a lot the beauty lying between the elegance of the human genome and the complexity of human brain. Wish I could fit my two bits in computer science into the puzzle of the genome function. </p>
	<p>I act as the Director of Computational Neuroscience in Dr. Scherzer's <a href="http://www.scherzerlaboratory.org/">Neurogenomics Laboratory</a> in Brigham and Women's Hospital, an Instructor in Harvard Medical School, and founder of a weekly <a href="http://bioinformatics.bwh.harvard.edu">Bioinformatics Club</a> in BWH. I'm recently funded for <a href="https://www.apdaparkinson.org/research/what-we-fund/2017-18-funded-research/">Parkinson research</a>.</p>
