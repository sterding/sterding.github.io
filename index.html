	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm Xianjun Dong. I work on the human genome as a computer geek.</p>
	<p>While hiking to the peak of Science, I enjoy a lot the beauty lying between the elegance of the human genome and the complexity of <a href="http://humanbraincode.org">human brain</a>, where I wish to fit in my two bits as a computer geek. </p>
	<p>I act as the Director of <a href="http://bioinformatics.bwh.harvard.edu">Genomics and Bioinformatics Hub</a> in <a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/research/departments/center-for-neurologic-diseases/ann-romney-center-for-neurologic-diseases">ARCND</a> and of Computational Neuroscience in Dr. Scherzer's <a href="http://www.scherzerlaboratory.org/">Neurogenomics Laboratory</a> in Brigham and Women's Hospital, an Assistant Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. I'm recently funded for studying <a href="https://www.apdaparkinson.org/research/investigators/xianjun-dong-2/">Parkinson's disease</a>, and looking to bring bioinformatics to more collaborative research in brain diseases.</p>
