Transposon, also called transposable elements (TE) is one kind of mobile genetic elements (see other MGEs: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_genetic_elements).<br /><br />There are two classes of transposons:<br /><br /><b>Class I (Copy and Paste)</b>: <b><i>Retrotransposon</i></b>, which follows DNA--&gt;RNA--&gt;DNA. The DNA itself is transcribed into RNA (like a normal gene), then the RNA is reverse transcribed&nbsp;(by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcriptase">reverse transcriptase</a>)&nbsp;back to DNA, which is inserted into a new position in the genome. This is like the retrovirus, e.g. HIV, which retro-transcribes its RNA into DNA and merged with host cell's genome, then transcribe into new RNA and effects other cells.<br />Two subtypes of retrotransposons:<br /><br /><ol><li>LTR-retrotransposon: LTR is the short name for "long terminal repeat", which represents hundreds or thousands of times of a DNA sequence. They can encode reverse transcriptase, acting like a retrovirus.</li><li>non-LTR retrotransposon:&nbsp;</li><ul><li><b>LINE</b> (Long INterspersed Elements, also call 'jumping gene'): without LTR, also encode reverse transcriptase, transcribed by RNA <b>Pol2</b> (like a protein-coding gene). LINE-1 has promoter in its 5´, and polyA tail at its 3´. "The human genome, for example, contains about 500,000 LINEs, which is roughly 17% of the genome.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_interspersed_nucleotide_elements#cite_note-Cordaux-12">[13]</a>&nbsp;Of these, approximately 7,000 are full-length, a small subset of which are capable of retrotransposition.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_interspersed_nucleotide_elements#cite_note-Griffiths-13">[14]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_interspersed_nucleotide_elements#cite_note-14">[15]</a>. Interestingly, it was recently found that specific LINE-1 retroposons in the human genome are actively transcribed and the associated LINE-1 RNAs are tightly bound to nucleosomes and essential in the establishment of local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin">chromatin</a> environment.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_interspersed_nucleotide_elements#cite_note-15">[16]</a>" (wiki)</li><li><b>SINE</b> (Short INterspersed Elements): short DNA sequences (&lt;500nt). Don't encode reverse transcriptase itself and can transposition only with help of other mobile elements. SINEs usually look like DNA copies made by <b>Pol3-encoded</b> small RNAs e.g. tRNA, 5S rRNA etc. The most abundant repeat in human genome, <i>Alu</i>, is also classified into SINE.&nbsp;</li></ul></ol><br /><b>Class II (Cut and Paste)</b>: <b><i>DNA transposon</i></b>. Its movement does not generate RNA intermediate, but directly mediated by "various types of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposase">transposase</a> enzymes", either via a sequence-specific binding or non-specific binding.&nbsp;Around 42% of the human genome is made up of retrotransposons while DNA transposons account for about 2-3%.<br /><br />Here is a figure to show the&nbsp;transposable element content of the&nbsp;human genome (Nat. Rev. Genetics 2009,&nbsp;Richard Cordaux and Mark A. Batzer), where SVA is "an element that is made&nbsp;up of a short interspersed&nbsp;element (SINE) region, a&nbsp;variable number of tandem&nbsp;repeats (VNTR) region and&nbsp;an Alu-like region."<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WKn2f8alMVw/UD5TGN6yynI/AAAAAAAAAYI/hKyQ3dSl68Y/s1600/Screen+shot+2012-08-29+at+1.29.00+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WKn2f8alMVw/UD5TGN6yynI/AAAAAAAAAYI/hKyQ3dSl68Y/s1600/Screen+shot+2012-08-29+at+1.29.00+PM.png" /></a></div><br />Here are some figures illustrating the different types of repeats:&nbsp;http://studentreader.com/interspersed-repeats/<br /><br />Questions:<br /><ol><li>Are the RNAs transcribed from retrotransposons also exported to cytosol or just stay inside of the&nbsp;nucleus?&nbsp;</li><li>Are the locations of retrotransposon in genome largely fixed or varied between different cells/individual (non-cancer)?</li><li>Is the retrotransposon-copied-DNA inserted into the host genome in a random manner or only at specific locations (e.g. decided by sequence features)?</li></ol><div>Further readings:</div><div>1. http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v10/n10/pdf/nrg2640.pdf</div><div>2.&nbsp;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123860330000037</div>
