<a href="http://rafalab.jhsph.edu/" target="_blank">Rafa lab</a> has made a very nice serial of videos on The Statistics of Genomics. Here is the one talking about useful plots in genomics, esp. for next generation sequencing.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://2.gvt0.com/vi/46-t2jOYsyY/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/46-t2jOYsyY&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/46-t2jOYsyY&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><br />Among the many interesting tips, one is to replace the MA plot with volcano plot to better&nbsp;demonstrate&nbsp;the differential expressed genes.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QWdUtzRwjrA/UKv1gss2RpI/AAAAAAAAAZw/Puk4Npreek8/s1600/Screen+shot+2012-11-20+at+4.26.07+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QWdUtzRwjrA/UKv1gss2RpI/AAAAAAAAAZw/Puk4Npreek8/s1600/Screen+shot+2012-11-20+at+4.26.07+PM.png" /></a></div><br />Here is a description of volcano plot from <a href="http://discover.nci.nih.gov/microarrayAnalysis/Statistical.Tests.jsp" target="_blank">NIH site</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="background-color: white;">However one chooses to compute the significance values (p-values) of the genes, it is interesting to compare the size of the fold change to the statistical significance level. <u>The ‘volcano plot’ arrange genes along dimensions of biological and statistical significance. </u>The first (horizontal) dimension is the fold change between the two groups (on a log scale, so that up and down regulation appear symmetric), and the second (vertical) axis represents the p-value for a t-test of differences between samples (most conveniently on a negative log scale – so smaller p-values appear higher up). The first axis indicates biological impact of the change; the second indicates the statistical evidence, or reliability of the change. The researcher can then make judgements about the most promising candidates for follow-up studies, by trading off both these criteria by eye.&nbsp;</span></blockquote><span style="background-color: white;">It mentioned using t-test to get a p-value for each g</span>ene, to see whether the means of two groups are <i>statistically</i> different from each other.<br /><br />What I was confused is: What's the difference between t-test and Wilcox test? Shamed on my poor knowledge on statistics, I was reading a bit on this. And here is what I got from <a href="http://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~kcowles/s166_2008/GuangmingLiupaper-project.pdf" target="_blank">Vacide Avsar et al.'s paper</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Student’s t-Test is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic&nbsp;has a Student’s t distribution if the null hypothesis is true.<br />Different hypothesis tests make different assumptions about the distribution of the random sample in the data. <span style="background-color: yellow;">One of the assumptions for the&nbsp;t-test is that the data are independently sampled from a normally distributed&nbsp;population.</span> This assumption about the population distribution makes the<span style="background-color: yellow;">&nbsp;t-test be a parametric statistical test</span>. In some cases, the data within two&nbsp;correlated samples may fail to meet this assumption. When this happens,&nbsp;an appropriate non-parametric alternative test can be found. One of these&nbsp;<span style="background-color: yellow;">non-parametric alternative tests is called the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test</span>.<br />Like the t-test, Wilcoxon test involves comparison of the differences between measurements. On the other hand, it does not require assumptions&nbsp;about the form of the distribution of the measurements. It should therefore&nbsp;be used whenever the distributional assumptions that underlie t-test cannot&nbsp;be satisﬁed.</blockquote>So, t-test is a parametric statistical test and Wilcoxon is a non-parametric statistical test. And t-test assumes the data were independently sampled from a normal distribution while Wilcox test does not.<br /><br />At the end of the paper, the authors concluded that t-test has slightly better power than wilcox test.<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span>
