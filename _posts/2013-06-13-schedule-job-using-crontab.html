Most of you may already know it.<br /><br />In terminal, type "crontab -e" you will enter edit mode to edit the crontab file, which has format as below:<br /><br />0 0 * * * rm ~/scratch/.*.bam<br />0 0 * * 2,5 find ~/scratch/mouse* -exec touch {} \;<br /><br />It's like Vim. After finishing the editing, type ":wq" to save/quit.<br /><br />The 5th column is to set day of the action, e.g. 2,5 means every Tuesday and Friday. Get more detail by 'man crontab'.<br /><div><br /></div>
