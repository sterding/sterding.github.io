In a simple case, you can use&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">bsub command arguments&nbsp;</span>to submit your command job to LSF cluster.<br /><br />If you have a complicated script with many commands, &nbsp;you can save into a lsf script (including the shell pathname in the first  line) and then submit that script to LSF cluster, e.g. &nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">bsub yourscript arguments</span><br /><br />In your script, you wrote something like this:<br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">#!/bin/bash</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">myFirstArgument = $1</span><br /><br />Here I found I can also use pipe to connect multiple commands into one line and simply quote them as one command and works in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">bsub</span>. Here is an example:<br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br /></span>        <br /><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">bsub "echo -ne 'ab\tcss' | awk '{print \$2}'"</span></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br /></span></span></div>So far, I found I have to add "\" (backslash) to escape the special character, such as $ in awk. Wondering there might be a way in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">bsub</span> options to set this.
