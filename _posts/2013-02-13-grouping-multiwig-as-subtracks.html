This is not a tip, but a request (to a UCSC genome feature).<br /><br /><div>I was trying to set multiWig containers as a subtrack of a composite (as below), but it does not work.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">track CAGE<br />compositeTrack on<br />shortLabel CAGE<br />longLabel CAGE Tracks<br />type bed 3<br />visibility full<br />priority 20<br />subGroup1 view Views SGuniq=Signal_Uniqmap SGall=Signal_Allmap<br />subGroup2 stage Stage 10dpp=10dpp 20dpp=20dpp <br />subGroup3 treatment treatment wt=Wild_Type<br />dimensions dimensionX=treatment dimensionY=stage<br />sortOrder stage=+ treatment=+ view=+<br />dragAndDrop subTracks<br />configurable on<br /><br />     track CageUniqmapsignal<br />    shortLabel Signal<br />    view SGuniq<br />    type bigWig<br />    autoScale on<br />    alwaysZero on<br />    windowingFunction maximum<br />    maxHeightPixels 50:50:11<br />    parent CAGE<br /><br />         # --------- 10dpp ---------<br />        track 10dpp_wt_CAGE_uniq<br />        container multiWig<br />        shortLabel CAGE_uniq<br />        longLabel 10dpp_wt_CAGE_uniq<br />        aggregate transparentOverlay<br />        showSubtrackColorOnUi on<br />        subGroups view=SGuniq stage=10dpp treatment=wt<br />        parent CAGE<br /><br />track 10dpp_wt_CAGE_uniq.plus<br /> bigDataUrl http://10dpp_wt_CAGE_uniq+.bw<br /> parent 10dpp_wt_CAGE_uniq<br /> color 0,0,255&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br /> track 10dpp_wt_CAGE_uniq.minus<br /> bigDataUrl http://10dpp_wt_CAGE_uniq-.bw<br /> parent 10dpp_wt_CAGE_uniq<br /> color 255,0,0<br />         # --------- tracks for other stages... ---------</span><br /><br /><br />Just found that UCSC has not implemented it yet. <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/soe.ucsc.edu/forum/#!msg/genome/If7nFxpmvzw/iNT3FPXV0GkJ">Here</a> is the message:<br /><br />"It is not currently possible to combine bigBeds and bigWigs into a multiWig <br />track.  They can be combined into a multiple view composite.  The bigWigs <br />could be combined into a multiWig, but that multiWig cannot itself be part <br />of a composite.  The bigWigs could be displayed both in a multiWig and as <br />subtracks of a separate composite that also contains bigWigs. <br /><br />In the future there may be a "container" like multiWig that will contain <br />both bigBeds and bigWigs.  Separately, in the future we may support a <br />multiWig as one subtrack of a composite.  However, neither of these is <br />currently supported." <br /><br /> Hope this can be implemented soon!!!<br /><br /> (If anyone has a solution to the problem, please let me know. Thanks very much)</div>
