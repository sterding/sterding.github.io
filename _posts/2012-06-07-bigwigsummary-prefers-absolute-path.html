I just got this&nbsp;weird&nbsp;error when I was running bigwigsummary on a bigwig file - it keeps saying:<br /><br /><br />Can't open ~/scratch/bw/wgEncodeOpenChromChipMcf7Pol2Aln_2Reps.norm5.rawsignal.bw to read<br />No such file or directory<br /><br />But&nbsp;obviously the file is there with permission of 755 (-rwxr-xr-x).<br /><br />Finally by taking Brian's suggestion, I used absolute path, instead of relative path with tilde (e.g. ~ ), the error disappeared.<br /><br />Don't know if this is required by the code itself or just an usual difference between ~ and /home.<br /><div><br /></div>
