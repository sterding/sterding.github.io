A very precise &amp; concise post about this is here:&nbsp;http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html<br /><br />A short answer is,<br /><br />.bash_profile is executed to configure your shell when you login (type username and password) via console, locally or remotely. Just like each time when you ssh to your cluster/server, it will automatically call .bash_profile.<br /><br />.bashrc is executed when you start a new bash instance, either by opening a new terminal window or start a new bash script. So, say in Mac, when you type Command+T to open a new tab, it will call .bashrc.&nbsp;<div><br /></div>Note that Mac OS Xâ€™s Terminal.app, which runs a login shell by default for each new terminal window, calls .bash_profile instead of .bashrc. This is an exception!<div><br /></div><div>Josh recommend to solve the confusion by calling .bashrc in .bash_profile, such as&nbsp;</div><div><blockquote style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;"><pre class="code" style="font-family: courier, monospace; font-style: normal;">if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then<br />   source ~/.bashrc<br />fi</pre></blockquote></div>
