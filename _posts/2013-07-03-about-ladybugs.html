Yesterday Mia found a ladybug flying around the lamp in living room. We caught it and later released it to the outside. It has more black spots on red wing, unlike a seven-spot one we usually see. So, I read a bit about the classification of ladybugs.<br /><br />OK. Here is it. Its Latin name is&nbsp;<i>Harmonia axyridis</i>, one kind of Coccinellidae commonly seen in North America. Wikipedia says, "It is commonly known as the <b>harlequin ladybird</b> (because it occurs in numerous colour forms). It is also known in North America as the <b>multicolored Asian lady beetle</b>, and (because it invades homes in October in preparation for overwintering) as <b>Halloween lady beetle</b>." Here is the photo of their patterns:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OL60qX2ekUw/UdQ7JfXFrYI/AAAAAAAAAfo/B_WSok111zA/s1400/Harmonia_axyridis01.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="505" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OL60qX2ekUw/UdQ7JfXFrYI/AAAAAAAAAfo/B_WSok111zA/s640/Harmonia_axyridis01.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>Based on the pattern, it can be divided into 3 forms:<br />red or orange with black spots (form <i>succinea</i>); <br />black with four red spots (form <i>spectabilis</i>); <br />black with two red spots (form <i>conspicua</i>). <br /><div><br /></div><div>The one Mia saw should be the succinea form.&nbsp;</div>
