catecholamines (儿茶酚胺) is the collection name for three neurotransmitters: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine">epinephrine</a> (adrenaline), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine">norepinephrine</a> (noradrenaline) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine">dopamine</a>.<br /><br />L-DOPA is its precursor. Its corresponding drug is called levodopa.<br /><br />L-DOPA is produced from the amino acid L-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine">tyrosine</a> by the enzyme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_hydroxylase">tyrosine hydroxylase</a> (TH). <br /><br />Tyrosine cannot pass the BBB (blood brain barrier), but L-DOPA can. <br /><br />L-DOPA can be converted to dopamine, which can be further converted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine">epinephrine</a> (adrenaline), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine">norepinephrine</a> (noradrenaline). <br /><br />Dopaminergic neurons can be divided into 11 cell groups according to where they located, using histochemical fluorescence method. It includes A8-A16, Aaq and Telencephalic group. Among that, A9 is where the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) refers. <br /><br />Number of TH-positive neurons in SN declines with age, while a-synuclein level increases with age. This inverse relationship is also seen in the surviving DA neurons of PD patients. <br /><br />And it shows that the down-regulation of TH is linked to a reduction of expression of transcription factor called Nurr1 (orphan nuclear receptor, encoded by gene NR4A2). <br /><br />Nurr1 is shown to regulate a category of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes.
