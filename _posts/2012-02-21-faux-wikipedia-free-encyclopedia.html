<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faux">Faux - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>: "Faux ( /ˈfoʊ/) is a French word for "false".<br />When manufacturing faux objects or materials, an attempt is often made to create products which will resemble the imitated items as closely as possible. However, some products are intentionally made to look "faux", for example, faux furs made for prospective buyers who want their fur to be recognizable as imitation due to controversy over the use and manufacture of real animal furs.<br />"<br /><br />pronounced like 'pho', not 'fox'.
