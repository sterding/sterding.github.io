<b>Deviation</b>: difference between observation and mean of the population, e.g Xi-E(X)<br /><br /><b>Residual</b>: the difference between observed value and predicted/estimated value.<br /><br /><b>Error</b>: the difference btw the observed value and the real value (which is usually unobservable)<br /><br /><b>MSE</b> (Mean square error): the E[(X-X')^2], where X' is the real value of X.<br /><div><br /></div><div><b>Standard deviation</b>: square root of the mean squared deviation. eg. sqrt(E[(Xi-u)^2]). It's square root of variance (see below)<br /><br /><b>Variance</b>: a measurement of the dispersion for a set of numbers/observations (e.g. how far they are spread out from each other). If they have a mean, then variance is defined as E[(Xi-u)^2], where u is E(X). It's square of standard deviation.&nbsp;</div>
