<a href="http://ss64.com/bash/fgrep.html">fgrep MAN Page</a>: "fgrep<br /><br />Search file(s) for lines that match a fixed string<br /><br />Syntax<br />     fgrep  ...<br /><br />fgrep is the same as `grep -F'<br /><br />all other options are the same as grep<br />It's a popular fallacy that fgrep stands for fast-grep, in fact fgrep means fixed-string grep.<br /><br />fgrep implements the Ahoâ€“Corasick string matching algorithm which is very fast at matching multiple strings in the input stream/file. So if fgrep is used like this:<br /><br />fgrep -f patternlist.txt largetextfile.txt<br /><br /><b><span >it is much faster than<br /></span></b><br />grep -f patternlist.txt largetextfile.txt<br /><br />Matching a single pattern with fgrep is not significantly faster than grep.<br /><br />"The knowledge imposes a pattern, and falsifies, For the pattern is new in every moment..." - T. S. Eliot"<br /><br /><a style="font-size:13px" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pengoopmcjnbflcjbmoeodbmoflcgjlk">'via Blog this'</a>
