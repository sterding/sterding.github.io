However, it may be what you are looking for.<br /><br />`--reply=HOW'<br />*Deprecated: to be removed in 2008.*<br />Using `--reply=yes' makes `cp' act as if `yes' were given as a<br />response to every prompt about a destination file. That<br />effectively cancels any preceding `--interactive' or `-i' option.<br />Specify `--reply=no' to make `cp' act as if `no' were given as a<br />response to every prompt about a destination file. Specify<br />`--reply=query' to make `cp' prompt the user about each existing<br />destination file.<br /><br /><br />What you would do (I think) is do cp -i --reply=no<br /><br />That way, it will ask if you want to overwrite the file and automatically say "no."
