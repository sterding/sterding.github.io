Many track types allow setting a color range that varies from color to altColor. For instance the CpG Island tracks use the altColor setting to display the weaker islands, while the stronger ones are rendered in color. <b>If altColor is not specified, the system will use a color halfway between that specified in the color tag and white instead</b>.<br /><br /><b>Be aware that wiggles with negative values are drawn in altColor not color as positive values are</b>.
