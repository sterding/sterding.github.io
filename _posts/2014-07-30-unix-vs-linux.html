I'd love to share a nice article about the difference between Linux and Unix (Believe me, not everyone knows the difference): <br /><a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/what-is-the-difference-between-linux-and-unix/">http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/what-is-the-difference-between-linux-and-unix/</a><br /><br />From there (also from Wiki), I learned that<br /><div><ul><li>Linux is just a kernel while Unix is a complete operating system.&nbsp;</li><li>Unix was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie (also the creator of the C programming language) and&nbsp;Ken Thompson from Bell lab around 1970s, while the Linux kernel was written by a Finnish CS student&nbsp;Linus Torvalds in 1991.&nbsp;</li><li>A typical Linux distribution (or GNU/Linux as Free Software Foundation calls) comprises a Linux kernel, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU">GNU</a> tools and libraries, additional software, documentation, a window system, window manager, and a desktop environment.&nbsp;</li><li>There are 600+ Linux distributions (or GNU/Linux), with 300+ are in active development.&nbsp;</li><li>Some popular mainstream Linux distributions include Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora, openSUSE, Arch Linux, and the commercial Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Their full relationship/timeline can be referred here:&nbsp;<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg</a><br /><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg" width="640" /></a></li><li>Android is also Linux-based, but does not include a command-line interface and programs made for typical Linux distributions.</li><li>Mac OS is not linux-based. Its version 10, Max OS X is actually a Unix operating system.&nbsp;</li><li>Other popular Unix systems include: HP-UX, IBM AIX, Sun Solairs, IRIX. They are based on different kernels. See details here:&nbsp;<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg</a><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div></li><li>iOS is also based on Mac OS X, therefore it's also a Unix OS.</li></ul></div>
